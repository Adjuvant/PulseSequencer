# PulseSequencer

A pulse-based sequencer for Unity3d, as seen in http://derelictcomputer.itch.io/pulsars

The PulseSequencer allows composers to create 3d, polyrhythmic music using Unity's built-in audio system. It also allows for triggering visual effects, such as animations or light lerps in sync with the music.

You can clone or fork this repo, or [download the Unity package](PulseSequencer.unitypackage) and import it into your project. (Note: to download the Unity package, just hit the button that says "Raw" on the linked page.)

To get started, check out the example scene, or:
- Add a Pulse, Pattern, and Sampler to a scene
- Reference the Pulse in the Pattern object
- Reference the Pattern in the Sampler object
- Add a sample and reference an AudioClip in the Sampler object
- Add some steps to the Pattern object

This project is very young, and therefore many safeguards and editor helpers are not implemented. I'm using this in my own projects, and will be updating this repository as I add features in those projects. So please bear with me! If you have any feature requests or find any bugs, please feel free to report them via the issue tracker.

Thanks, have fun, and please let me know if you use this. I'd love to see and hear what you do with it!

If you like using the Pulse Sequencer, and want to help me develop it, that's awesome! There are a few ways you can help:
- Submit bugs and feature requests via the issue tracker. This will help me know what people want to see, and prioritize those things.
- If you're a coder, fork the repo and submit pull requests for features and bug fixes. This gets a lot better if I have help!
- If you can, consider [becoming a patron](https://www.patreon.com/derelictcomputer)!
