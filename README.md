# PulseSequencer

A pulse-based sequencer for Unity3d, as seen in http://derelictcomputer.itch.io/pulsars

The PulseSequencer allows composers to create 3d, polyrhythmic music using Unity's built-in audio system. It also allows for triggering visual effects, such as animations or light lerps in sync with the music.

To get started:
- Add a Pulse, Pattern, and Sampler to a scene
- Reference the Pulse in the Pattern object
- Reference the Pattern in the Sampler object
- Add a sample and reference an AudioClip in the Sampler object
- Add some steps to the Pattern object

This project is very young, and therefore many safeguards and editor helpers are not implemented. I'm using this in my own projects, and will be updating this repository as I add features in those projects. So please bear with me! If you have any feature requests or find any bugs, please feel free to report them via the issue tracker.

Thanks, have fun, and please let me know if you use this. I'd love to see and hear what you do with it!
